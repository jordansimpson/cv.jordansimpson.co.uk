								<p>Jordan is what I consider to be a real designer in that he not only has a great design eye and knows how to make things look <q>pretty</q> but sees the the bigger picture and thinks about goals of the project and the end user. He's also a proficient front-end coder making him a well-rounded web professional. I've had the pleasure of working with Jordan on and off for the past couple of years and hope to do so again in the future.</p>
